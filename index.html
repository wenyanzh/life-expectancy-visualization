                Across the world, people are living longer compared to before. Life expectancy of a newborn has 
                more than doubled globally, from an average life of 32 years in 1900, to 71 years in 2021.
                However, is this change equal across different countries? 
                <br> <br> 
                To answer this question, we will look into an interactive slideshow and explore factors related to the wide differences 
                in life expectancy between countries, such as GDP and healthcare expenditure. 
                We with focus on comparing countries with highest and lowest average life expectancy and compared them 
                to the United States. Additionally, we will explore the trends of life expectancy for each country.
